# A Shopping List App

The shopping list app was created to show off what I have learned and can in a limited amount of time. 

Given a task it took about 3 days to complete the project. 

App is mainly created with Express.js, Sequelize, BootStrap, React, and NodeJs.

I started with making the starting views as I had never made a good full-stack React App. I did my best to make it so that there would be limited requests to the server to serve the user a optimized seemless-like experience that takes out the headaches of many basic apps made by amateurs with slower loading times. Those apps make you wonder if the information you put in is valid or not. 

The app was one of the more fun apps to construct as I was using JSX full-stack for the first time. Been looking forward since I learned React.js what an app like this could operate as ejs was not my favorite. 

# Technical Details

The app has basically 4 differents pages: List of lists, list of items, sign in, sign up. Very simple and clean design. Anything that was not neccessary was taken out. 

CSS was not a main focus and it still did come out pretty good regarding I was only using the Bootstrap CSS. 

I had some struggles with the 1:1 associations between the users and the lists of the users. It had to just be on the list that it had belonged to the user. I had been stating the association on both before I had found the issue. 

I did separate the components out so they would be easy to use had I needed to add them to multiple pages. Originally I was going to put in a NavBar but then I realized it made the app more complicated than it had to. 

# Ending Message 

Overall the project was a refreshing experience, one that will get me started in the full-stack realm. This is a good starting point for a portfolio project and will continue to be a reference for when I need to figure out an issue with the database or views. I could have made it so that it could have been more optimized using Webpack but the app is so small that it would only change a little bit of the speed when it comes to making the app more responsive feeling. The app is also decent for mobile devices which is good to know for the entire reason the app was made for, to be used as a shopping list.
